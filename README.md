# 🍕 Python Pizza Order Billing Program

A simple command-line pizza ordering system in Python.  
The program asks the user for pizza size, optional toppings, and then calculates the final bill.

This project is part of my **Python learning journey**, where I practiced conditionals, string input handling, and simple billing logic.
